## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned to add an icon to the web tab

```html
<link
            rel="icon"
            type="image/png"
            sizes="32x32"
            href="./images/favicon-32x32.png"
        />
```
I also learned to add color to a an image
```css
.img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: linear-gradient(
            hsla(277, 59%, 30%, 0.6),
            hsla(277, 59%, 30%, 0.6)
        ),
        url('./images/image-header-desktop.jpg');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
}
```


### Continued development

I'd like to practice more on responsiveness, maybe make the change from mobile view to desktop view, a bit smoother.
